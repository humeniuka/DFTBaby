Automatic fitting of repulsive potentials 
-----------------------------------------

This file describes the contents of this directory and how to use it for fitting repulsive
potentials.

STRUCTURES/
  contains optimized geometries for representative classes of molecules. Based on these,
  fit paths are generated by stretching bonds or randomly displacing an atom around its
  equilibrium structure, so as to generate a large number of different interatomic distance
  for each pair of atom types. The script 'make_fitpaths.sh' generates such displacements
  and stores them in the folder 'FIT_PATHS'.

FIT_PATHS/
  contains the fit paths

DFTB/ and REFERENCE/
  For each geometry in a fit path the total energy is computed using DFTB and a reference method
  (e.g. LC-PBEPBE/6-311++G*) using Gaussian. To compute the DFTB or reference data run

     calc_fitpaths.sh  dftb

  or

     calc_fitpaths.sh reference

  respectively. The reference calculation requires Gaussian 09. The total energy with DFTB or
  the reference method are stored in

     DFTB/<fit path>.energies.dat

  and

     REFERENCE/<fit path>.energies.dat

  The repulsive potentials are fitted to reproduce the difference between the two, E(ref) - E(dftb),
  as good as possible.

REPPOT_TABLES/
  To fit repulsive potentials based on the fit paths and reference calculations
  run

     FitReppots.py ./

  This should load the fit geometries and the data from DFTB and reference calculations and perform
  a least square fit. The resulting repulsive potentials will be stored in the folder REPPOT_TABLES.
