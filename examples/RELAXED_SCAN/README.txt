In this example a relaxed energy scan is performed for rotation
around the single bond linking the two phenyl rings. The optimization
is started with the command:

   GeometryOptimization.py  phenylbenzene.xyz

A table with the energies for each step is written to `phenylbenzene_scan.dat`
and the scan geometries are saved to `phenylbenzene_scan.xyz`.
