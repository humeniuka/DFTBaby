To compute the bound and continuum orbitals and photoelectron angular
distributions of water with the MS and CMS methods run

   electroSka.py  water.json

The second example skips the calculation of bound orbitals and uses Dyson
orbitals provided in the molden file 'furan_dyson.molden' as initial states.
