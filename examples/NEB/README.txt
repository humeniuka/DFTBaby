The nudged elastic band algorithm is used to find the minimum energy
reaction path for the flip of the water molecule:

  H               H
   \             /
    O   <--->   O
   /             \
  H               H

The file 'water_flip.xyz' contains the educt and product structures with
possible intermediate structures that could be generated by the program
'interpolate_linearly.py'.

To to optimize the reaction path on the ground state (I=0) execute:

  optimize_neb.py water_flip.xyz 0 --verbose=0

The geometries of the images are saved for every 10th iteration to files called

  neb_NAME_##.xyz

The energy along the path are saved as a table in a file called

  path_energies_NAME_##.dat
